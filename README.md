# Lightweight WordPress PHP-FPM & Nginx Docker Image
This is maintained repository. We use this project in production and recommend this for your projects too.

## Aren't you only supposed to run one process per container?
We think that docker container should be small set of processes which provide one service.

## This container includes:
### For running WordPress
- php7
- php-fpm7
- nginx

### For testing WordPress (Or any web application)
- phantomjs
- ruby
- poltergeist
- rspec
- capybara
